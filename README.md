# Features
Roots offers the following features:

## Online courses: 
ROOTS provides online courses in Igbo language. Our courses include written lessons, audio recordings, and video lessons. The lessons cover topics such as basic vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. The courses are self-paced, allowing learners to study at their own pace.

## Interactive exercises: 
Our platform includes interactive exercises, such as quizzes and fill-in-the-blank exercises, that allow learners to practice what they've learned. These exercises provide immediate feedback, helping learners to identify areas where they need to improve.

## Community features: 
ROOTS offers community features such as forums and social media groups, where learners can connect with each other and with native speakers of the language. This allows learners to practice their language skills and to ask questions about the language and culture. The community features are moderated to ensure a safe and respectful environment for all users. These features allow learners to connect with other language learners and practice their language skills in a supportive environment.

## Chatbot
ROOTS will feature a chatbot that will assist users in understanding the product and provide quick and efficient support to their queries. The chatbot will be built using Tiledesk, a powerful chatbot platform that enables developers to easily create, test, and deploy chatbots for various use cases. The chatbot will utilize Tiledesk's NLP engine to understand user intent and provide relevant responses based on context.
